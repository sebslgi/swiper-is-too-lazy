<h1>Swiper is too lazy =/</h1>

<p>To reproduce the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>click on a animal link (cat or dog)</li>
  <li>do <strong>NOT</strong> swipe to see more images (I dare you)</li>
  <li>click on another animal link (dog or cat)</li>
</ul>

<p>And you'll see the loader for ever (or at least you try to swipe</p>
